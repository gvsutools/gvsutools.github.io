Welcome to the new site of GVTools! Dan and I have been working on the site in order to provide a landing page for releasing BetterPlanner, GVTools' first piece of software.

The site is written using [Octopress][octo], a static site generator built on GitHub's [Jekyll][jekyll] generator. Expect some changes as we get used to this new tooling and learn how to style our site.

We look forward to seeing you in the future!
