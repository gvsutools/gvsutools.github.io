VPN AppleScript is a small project designed to automate use of GVSU's [student][student-vpn] or faculty virtual private network (VPN) on Mac OS X. This is useful for people who make use of the VPN frequently (as we do in [BetterPlanner](/projects/better-planner/)).

For full instructions on downloading and using VPN AppleScript, see [the GitHub page][gh-vpn].
