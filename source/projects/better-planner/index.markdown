For course registration, GVSU uses a system known as myBanner. myBanner has earned a reputation among students and faculty for being frustratingly inefficient to use. Tasks which should be simple often take many clicks to accomplish.

The goal of BetterPlanner is to solve many of these issues. Rather than attempting to do everything myBanner does, BetterPlanner takes often-used features and makes them far easier.

Current features:

* **Course Search** Start typing the identifier or title to find any course. Switch semesters by selecting from a drop-down box.
* **Schedule View** Easy view your schedule from any semester.

Planned features:

* **Remember Me** Never type your myBanner login credentials again! BetterPlanner will remember and securely store your credentials on your computer. *Planned for first release*.
* **Course Registration** Register for courses by clicking a single button within the search view. *Planned for first release*.
* **Course Sniping** Grab a course quickly when registration opens, or wait for an opening in a closed course.
* **Google Calendar Upload** Easily enter your schedule in your calendar using your Google account.
