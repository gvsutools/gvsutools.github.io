GVTools is a small organization started by GVSU Computer Science major Sean Fisk in 2011 with the motto "Software *for* GVSU students *by* GVSU students." GVTools has two goals:

* Produce software for GVSU students that is useful and usable by the general student population.
* Give participating students an idea of what it is like to work with a team to build and release high-quality software.

GVTools' main product is called BetterPlanner, a tool for managing a student's schedule in a similar manner to MyBanner.
