<!-- We had an idea to create an image map where each participant can be clicked, sending the visitor to the participant's bio. However, our layout supports auto-resizing of images, which kind of ruins the image map thing. -->

> Sean founded GVTools in 2011 while working on his undergraduate at GVSU. He graduated with a BS in Computer Science in 2012 followed by an MS in Computer Science in 2014, both from GVSU. While studying for his degrees, Sean held two internships at local software development company [Atomic Object][ao] as well as traveling to Boulder, CO for an internship at the [National Center for Atomspheric Research][ncar]. He was also a member of the Laker Marching Band on snare drum for 6 years. Sean's interests include compilers, automation, and high-performance computing. Outside of programming, Sean enjoys biking, skiing, disc golf, singing, and playing guitar.

> Dan joined the GVTools team in December 2013. He came to GVSU with the intention of pursuing a career in the medical field. He was initially taking classes in preparation for nursing school, and was even a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA). However, early in 2013, he decided that a career in computer science would better suit his interests, and switched degrees. He still is interested in the medical field, and would like to combine computers and medicine, and plans to do that with a masters degree in bioinformatics. Dan loves to spend time outside backpacking, camping, mountain biking, skateboarding, and playing all kinds of sports. He also keeps busy building skateboards, knitting, playing several instruments, and looking at funny cat pictures on the internet.
