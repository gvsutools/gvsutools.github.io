<!-- We had an idea to create an image map where each participant can be clicked, sending the visitor to the participant's bio. However, our layout supports auto-resizing of images, which kind of ruins the image map thing. -->

> Dan joined the GVTools team in December 2013. He came to GVSU with the intention of pursuing a career in the medical field. He was initially taking classes in preparation for nursing school, and was even a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA). In early 2013, he changed his career path and switched degrees to computer science. He is planning on getting a degree in bioinformatics, to combine computer science and medicine. Dan loves to spend time outside backpacking, camping, mountain biking, skateboarding, and playing all kinds of sports. He also keeps busy building skateboards, knitting, playing several instruments, and looking at funny cat pictures on the internet.

> Spencer started working with GVTools in Winter 2014. His main interests in joining were to learn to develop in a team and to learn Python in depth outside of class. He has been attending GVSU since the Fall of 2012 for a major in Computer Science as well as a minor in Business. While not in school, reading Marvel Comics, programming, tinkering with software, cycling, and long boarding are the hobbies best enjoyed by Spencer. His favorite catch phrase is: 'Hulk smash!' said by none other than The Incredible Hulk.
