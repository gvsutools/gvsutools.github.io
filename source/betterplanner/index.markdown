BetterPlanner is a piece of software that allows GVSU students to view their schedule and search for classes in the application rather than mybanner.

History
-------
BetterPlanner was started by Sean Fisk in the winter of 2012.

Future

BetterPlanner is currently in development, with several major updates planned. Soon, students will be able to add and drop classes directly in BetterPlanner.
