TODO
====

* Add BetterPlanner page.
* Finish bios and photos for team page.
* Favicon. Can probably just use the BetterBanner one for now. Maybe make a cheap 'GVT' one, black text and transparent background.

# Style

* Responsive layout nukes the nav bar when shrunk.
* Re-color links so they look better. Probably should be more subtle, especially on the team page.
* Make team page with floats more responsive.
